pipestatus - source file for POSIX shell that allows
to obtain an exit status of every program in a pipe.

                        MOTIVATION

When we program in shell we often run pipes like this

    prog1 args1 | prog2 args2 | ... | progN argsN

POSIX says that exit status of pipe is the exit status of LAST program
in it, i.e.  progN in our example. That is, exit status of all other
programs in pipe is silently ignored.  But in many situations exit
status of all programs in pipe should be checked to make program
robust. Some shells like BASH and ZSH have special extensions for
doing this but POSIX shell unfortunately doesn't provide an EASY way
for doing this.

In short, this is why I wrote this piece of code, packaged it and
make it publicly available.

                         INSTALL

There is nothing to be built in 'pipestatus'.
Just copy 'pipestatus' file to the place PATH variable points to
You can also run ./pipestatus_demo for demo version and
sample of usage. ./selftest is also a good example.

I tested pipestatus with the following shells.

 - NetBSD-5 /bin/sh,
 - NetBSD-5 /bin/ksh
 - FreeBSD-6.2 /bin/sh
 - bash 3.2.9
 - bash 2.05b
 - zsh 4.2.6
 - zsh 4.2.6
 - mksh R28
 - pdksh 5.2.14
 - Debian dash 0.5.3-7
 - Solaris-10 /usr/xpg4/bin/sh (5.10 Generic_118833-36)
 - heirloom sh (http://sf.net/projects/heirloom)
 - Solaris /bin/sh (5.10 Generic_118833-36)

On all of them pipestatus works fine.
'set -e' mode was also tested.

If the following command 

    mkcmake test

fails on your system, please let me know.

                      DOCUMENTATION

Usage:
  . pipestatus 

Provided functions:
 runpipe_base, runpipe, runpipe0, runpipe_re,
 check_status, check_status0, check_status_re

Usage for 'runpipe*' functions:
   runpipe_base         prog1 [args1] '|' prog2 [args2] '|' ...
   runpipe              prog1 [args1] '|' prog2 [args2] '|' ...
   runpipe0             prog1 [args1] '|' prog2 [args2] '|' ...
   runpipe_re status_re prog1 [args1] '|' prog2 [args2] '|' ...

All runpipeX functions set the following variables:
  - pipestatus_1   - exit status of prog1,
  - pipestatus_2   - exit status of prog2,
  - ...
  - pipestatus_all - exit status of all progN separated by space,
  - pipesize       - a number of programs in pipe.

runpipe_base - always sets $? to zero

runpipe - sets $? to the exit status of the last program
           just like normal pipes do

runpipe0 - sets $? to zero if ALL programs in pipe
            returned zero exit status

runpipe_re - sets $? to zero if concatenated statuses of
            all programs in pipe correspond to 'status_re' expression

     'status_re' argument - allowed exit statuses for pipe.
              Example1: ". 0 0". Here . means that prog1
                  may exit with ANY status, prog2 may exit with status zero,
                  and prog3 - with status zero too.
              Example2: "0 0 0 [01]". Here [01] means that last program
                  may exit with status 0 or 1,
                  while first three - with status zero.

Usage for check_statusX functions:
   check_status
   check_status0
   check_status_re status_re

They set $? according to pipestatus_1, pipestatus_2 etc. variables
(they may be set by runpipe* functions)

If PIPESTATUS_VERBOSE variable is set to non-empty string, then
check_status0 and check_status_re functions print an error message to
stderr.
