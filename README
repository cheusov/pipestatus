pipestatus - source file for POSIX shell that allows
to obtain an exit status of every program in a pipe.

                        MOTIVATION

While programming in shell we often run pipes like this

    prog1 args1 | prog2 args2 | ... | progN argsN

Unfortunately POSIX says that exit status of the entire
pipe is the exit status of LAST program in it, i.e.
progN in our example. That is, exit status of all other
programs in pipe is silently ignored.
IMHO this is VEEEERY bad.

Solution - to check exit status of any/all programs in pipe
when it is necessary.

And this is exactly what 'pipetatus' actually does.
And this is why I packaged and publish this code.

============================================================

                         INSTALL

Just copy pipestatus to the place PATH variable points to
