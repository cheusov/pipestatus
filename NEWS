0.4.0
    - FIXED: 'check_status_re' and therefore 'runpipe_re'

    - ADDED: support for shells that do not support $10, $11 etc.
      That is now loooong pipes are supported in such shells.

    - FIXES: fixes for 'set -e' mode including those specific to
      Korn shell and its derivatives

    - ADDED: new variable 'pipestatus_all' is also
      set runpipe* function. It keeps exit statuses of
      all programs separated by space.

      and new Makefile target 'test'.
      Now you can test 'pipstatus' on with system.
